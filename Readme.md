All the files have the functionality as mentioned in the filenames.

In order to run them all you need is the training data that was provided to us & also augmented data.

In order to augment the data, run the Augmented data jupyter notebook file. It will create all the augmented data needed.

After that any file can be run in any order, it doesn't matter.

There are few files that might have errors in the output, that was done purposefully because of the filesize it ends up creating at the very end. Since github doesn't support large files, that was the only option left to reduce the size of the file


The libraries that are required to run all the files are as follow:
    -keras
    -tensorflow
    -scikit-learn
    -librosa
    -numpy
    -pandas
    -sklearn
    -matplotlib
    -pydot
    -Graphviz : This is a software that needs to be installed & this is for VAE jupyter notebook
